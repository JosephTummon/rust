# Rust Learning
My goal with this repo is to deploy a web application that uses a custom built ML model. 

I've decided to use Rust as a backend for this. 
The backend for this will be minimal and hopefully not too complicated. Since I'm keeping it simple I figured it might be a good opportunity to learn something new (Rust). 
I started to dive in and build it, but most of my experience is with Python and JavaScript so I pretty quickly resorted to copying and pasting from ChatGPT and Stack overflow without really understanding what I was doing. 

The goal of this project is to learn and keep it simple as I learn the basics so I'm going to work my way through [The Rust Programming Language][https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/] until I feel comfortable with the basic features of Rust.
I might work my way through the entire book before returning to build the backend for my web application. 
I might only do a few exercises and not look at it again.
I also might go back and forth between the book and my backend when I either learn something new from the book, or get stuck implementing a new feature in my backend. 

This folder of the directory will be all the code I write as I follow along with the book.
